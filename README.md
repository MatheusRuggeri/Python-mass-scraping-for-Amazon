# Python-mass-scraping-for-Amazon
Scraping for multiples products in Amazon with Python

This is a simple code, tested in june/2020 to Amazon scraping.
The code can scrape from different stores at the same time, this code includes BR, DE and USA store.

In the next versions I will include a CSV export and a price plot.
